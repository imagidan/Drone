# Drone V2

### Get Done by May 19, 2021

So instead of making Drone V1 again on PCB, I am going to do Drone V2. But this isn't the autonomous one yet. It is the stepping stone to that one and it deserves its own version number. This is basically a drone which won't be autonomous (Drone V3 now), but that motivates me enough to take my time on the project. Drone V2 will make the transition to Drone V3 much easier: it is an FPV (First-Person View) Drone: with powerful motors, a camera, a good controller (Not My Design), FPV Goggles (Not My Design), a full suite of sensors (including a carbon ppm sensor), Li-Ion Battery Pack, Charging IC, and my own design of ESCs. This drone will allow me to work with many potential components I could still need in Drone V3 while giving me a platform to collect training data for drone V3. I am also thinking of adding my first carbon capture prototype as a package the drone carries and then in V3 it will be integrated to the core.
