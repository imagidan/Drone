# Voltage Sensing

So the concept for measuring voltage is pretty easy to understand: You have 2 resistances in series dissipating a fraction of the total voltage. When you add those fractions you get 1. The fraction of the total resistance representing the grounded resistance is multiplied by the voltage of the circuit. It is important to make sure that the output voltage from the grounded resistor is smaller or equal to the max voltage of the analog input of the microcontroller. Another thing to think about is the more total resistance gets used, the less current gets wasted measuring voltage. When you want to measure a higher input, you will have a smaller grounded resistance ratio. Obviously, since the resolution on the microcontroller is normally stays the same, the higher the system voltage input, the lower the accuracy. When the voltage is lower, it might be necessary to have an amplifier of some kind. The amplifier might also make things a bit less accurate. Thus, the most precise Vs (supply voltage) is the one equal to the microcontroller's analog pin max voltage. Also, precision of the resistance value should also be considered. The value of the voltage read is then mapped to the max expected voltage.

As for my drone, I will use the mentioned considerations while making sure the resistance I get doesn't heat up too much, is light, and doesn't cost too much.
