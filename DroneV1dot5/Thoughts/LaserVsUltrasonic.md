So before we get deep into the matchup, these sensors have a lot in common. They both transmit light or sound waves and let them bounce back in their direction. Both waves are unsensable by humans in their respective domains. The time delay between sending and receiving the signal is then used to measure the distance between the sensor and the object. Other types of these sensors are RADAR (microwaves) and LiDAR (Light).

The advantage of light sensors is that they can be quite smaller & lighter, waterproof, and since SoL is faster than SoS, we get a more responsive sensor. One of the drawbacks is that light (laser) sensors need advanced electronics to measure time differences even better than ultrasonic sensors. Another good thing about light sensors is they can access more range due to their speed (at high costs) while ultrasonic sensors normally have more range (at low costs). 

I will probably choose a light sensor, because its getting cheaper for pretty good range, although I am not a big fan of using these sensors in the long term. In drone V2, I want everything to kind of be visual interface (cameras). Cameras are great not only for telling how far things are, but also for sensing orientation, height, acceleration, etc. without needing multiple devices all while being able to recognize people, and objects of all kinds.
