# Drone V1.5

### Get Done by May 19, 2021

So instead of making Drone V1 again on PCB, I am going to do Drone V1.5. This is basically a drone which won't be autonomous (Drone V2), but that motivates me enough to take my time on the project. Drone V1.5 will make the transition to Drone V2 much easier: it is an FPV (First-Person View) Drone: with powerful motors, a camera, a good controller (Not My Design), FPV Goggles (Not My Design), a full suite of sensors (including a carbon ppm sensor), Li-Ion Battery Pack, Charging IC, and my own design of ESCs. This drone will allow me to work with many potential components I could still need in Drone V2 while giving me a platform to collect training data for drone V2. I am also thinking of adding my first carbon capture prototype as a package the drone carries and then in V2 it will be integrated to the core.
